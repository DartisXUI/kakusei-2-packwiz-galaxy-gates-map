1. Click the Green "Code" Button.
2. Click on "Download ZIP".
3. Extract the files to your choice of location.
4. Copy the "saves" and "config" folders into your "Kakusei 2 Modpack"s "minecraft" folder.
   NOTE: Doing this WILL OVERWRITE your existing copy of "general.yml" in config/sgcraft/ folder. This WILL affect how the mod interacts with your previous worlds.
   The best solution to this, is to create a new instance of Kakusei 2.
5. Launch the game as usual.
6. As you explore, you'll find Loot Chests containing "Tome of the Ancients",
   which have 8 random Gate Addresses across the Galaxy (from the Overworld,
   The Nether & The End and most Advanced Rocketry Worlds).
7. Will you venture into the unknown and brave the dangers of airless Moons and Inferno Planets?
